# 4. Commentary on the Results from part 2 and 3

The graph showing the banking sector's profit by each bank tells us that the profits are shared across the board, with some banks standing out more in certain years. This diversity in profit distribution could mean a variety of strategies or market responses at play.

Table 1 shows a steady climb in total assets from 2021 to 2023, indicating the banks are growing stronger financially. It's not just about the profits they make each year; it also reflects their ability to grow their resources and investments over time.

In short, the banking sector is not only making more money but also building up its financial foundation, which is a good sign for stability and future growth. It's like watching a team not only win games but also strengthen their lineup for seasons to come.

# 9. Commentary on the Results from part 6,7  and 8 
from Part 6 Plot , it is noticable that for all banks that they were consistnet over all three years assets expect for the Revolut Bank, UAB. it had a notiacble increase in its assests starting from 2022, almost an increase by 800% and it also kept increasing the follwoing year.

from part 7 plot , it makes complete sense that the profit(loss) in millions matches alot the number of assets each bank has , implying a direct relation between number of assets and Profit(loss) in million for each bank bascially 

from part 8 plots , we seem to have three groups , the first is those banks whose loans to total ratio is very far ahead compared to its Cash to total ratio , these banks are ( UAB Medicinos bankas, B
Siauliu bankas, AB SEB bankas) , the second group has a balanced percentage between Cash to total and loans to total ratios , these are (  Swedbank, AB and AB ”Mano bankas" ) and the last group is the bank that always seems to be out of formation compared to other banke ,which is Revolut Bank, UAB , its Cash to total ratio is very high compared to its Loan To total ratio , which might explain why it had low assets at the 2021 year and low profit(loss) and then it started to grow eventually .
